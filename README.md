# ARS Auto-Detailing Website
A web application designed to provide my personal car detailing business with a modern, responsive website that informs customers and boosts online presence.

## Description
### Problem Statement
Local car detailing businesses often lack a professional, digital presence — missing out on customer engagement and trust.

### Why This Program Solves the Problem
This project provides a fully customizable website template built with modern technologies (React, TypeScript, Vite), giving small businesses an easy-to-maintain, attractive platform to showcase their services.

### Why Users Should Care
A visually appealing, responsive, and structured website helps build credibility and increases conversion rates for local service businesses, especially in highly competitive urban markets like Toronto.
